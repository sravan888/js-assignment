//There are six basic data types in JavaScript which can be divided into three main categories: primitive (or primary), composite (or reference), and special data types. String, Number, and Boolean are primitive data types.
// Object, Array, and Function (which are all types of objects) are composite data types. 
//primitive data type
//1.number: A number data type can be an integer, a floating point value, an exponential value, a ‘NaN’ or a ‘Infinity’.
var a=250; 
var b=25.5;  
var c = 10e4 
//2. string : The string data type in JavaScript can be any group of characters enclosed by a single or double-quotes or by backticks.
//var str1 = “This is a string1”;  // This is a string primitive type or string literal
//var str2= ‘This is a string2’;
var str3 = `This is a string3`;
//3.Boolean: The boolean data type has only two values, true and false. It is mostly used to check a logical condition.
typeof(true) // returns boolean
typeof(false) // returns boolean

// there are 4. null, 5.undefined.6.Symbol

//NON PRIMITIVE DATA TYPES
//1.object An object in JavaScript contains key-value pairs in its address.
var obj1 = { a: 5, b: 6 };
obj1[a] =7;
console.log(obj1) ;
//2.Array:An array in JavaScript is an object data type. An array contains more than one value with a numerical index.
var arr1= [1, 2, 3];
arr1[0] =4;
console.log(arr1) // This will return the array [4, 2, 3]
typeof (arr1) ;

//Function:JavaScript doesn’t have a function data type but when we find the data type of a function using the typeof operator, we find that it returns a function. 
function a(){ }
typeof(a);
